## Statements

### Complexity: For Loops
A single-table database D in which each row corresponds to a single person and each column corresponds to a feature about the person. The prover computes and publishes some analytic s = φ(D) of the dataset

#### 1. Proofs of aggregate statistics    
**Use Cases**    
* Prove that the data submitted to [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) is consistent with (a commitment to) a college's own registrar’s office database.    
* Publish Boston-area wage gap statistics by industry.    
* Demonstrate compliance with the Safe Harbor provision within the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

#### 2. Proofs of policy compliance
**Use Cases**  
* Develop mathematical policies P that formalize [Financial Privacy Rules](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/how-comply-privacy-consumer-financial-information-rule-gramm) categories as set by the FTC.    
* Formalize an institution's own privacy policies.

### Complexity:  Conditionals
An aggregation that computes a statistic over the records that passed the conditional check, the statistic s = (A ◦ F )(D), where the filtering step results in a dataset Dˆ pertaining to at least N people.

#### 1. Proofs of aggregate filtered statistics
**Use Cases**  
* Help Department of Youth Services to understand the rate of success of various intervention and early-release programs by `joining` their data with that of other state government agencies.

#### 2. Proofs of policy compliance with provenance
**Use Cases**  
*


### Complexity: Probability
#### 1. Proofs of private aggregate statistics
#### 2. Proofs of algorithmic fairness
